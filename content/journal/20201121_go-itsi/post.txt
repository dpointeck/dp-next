Title: itsi - a boilerplate for websites built with go

----

Text:

My primary goal in this year was to build this site you are on and the second one was to learn go. I asume that visiters know what go is, when not please look it up here: <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Golang</a>

The reason i chose to learn go is that collegues from work are using it and they love it. And also my team is also having an eye on it and there are a lot of ideas around distributed systems.

So i started learning it in April and found my self a lot on the Site of <a href="https://www.alexedwards.net/" target="_blank">Alex Edwards</a> which I highly recommend. I also bought his book Let's go, which I also highly recommend.

For training purpose I built this week itsi. A boilerplate for websites built with go. I also could have used a framework like gin-gonic but I wanted to go a more minimal way. It's just what I mostly need for prototyping an idea and not more.

### So what do you get from itsi?

- a structure how to layout your app
- a router
- dependency injection
- middleware setup
- panic handling

You can check itis out on github: <a href="https://github.com/dpointeck/go-itsi" target="_blank">go-itsi</a>
