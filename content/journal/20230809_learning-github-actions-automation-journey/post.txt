## Successfully Ignored Automation for Quite Some Time

I've been involved in development for a few years now, and somehow, I was able to ignore automation for quite a while. This only changed at the beginning of this year when I was tasked with containerizing the development of our embedded Linux at work. A coworker introduced me to GitLab CI. Since all my personal repositories are hosted on GitHub, I wanted to explore automation within that space. In the GitHub realm, CI is known as GitHub Actions.

The reason I never felt the itch to learn automation is because I always hosted my side projects on platforms like Vercel or Netlify. They make shipping so easy, and they're awesome companies. But as I want to progress, I decided to learn how to ship my side projects to my own Linux boxes, letting the serverless and edge stuff rest for a while.

## Setting Up a Linux Server

Before diving into GitHub Actions, I had to take care of a few prerequisites. I won't go into the details here, as I want to focus on the GitHub Actions part. The first thing I did was spin up a server instance with a hosting provider I trust. I chose the Ubuntu Server edition for the OS and installed Docker, as that's how I plan to deploy the projects onto this machine. To point domain names to my projects, I'm using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), a great piece of software, as a reverse proxy.

## Getting Started with GitHub Actions

The starting line for my learning journey was the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). Far too often, I want to go fast and just skim through the docs, but I always end up regretting not reading them properly. (Quick tip 💡: Read the f*** docs!)

After an initial introduction, it was time to get my hands dirty. I started a fresh GitHub repo and pulled it onto my notebook. I initialized a [Deno fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) starter app, and that's the base for my learning journey. Here's what the basic folder structure for our newly created fresh project looks like:

```bash
.
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── README.adoc
├── components
│   └── Button.tsx
├── deno-fresh.tar
├── deno-fresh.tar.gz
├── deno.json
├── dev.ts
├── fresh.gen.ts
├── islands
│   └── Counter.tsx
├── main.ts
├── routes
│   ├── [name].tsx
│   ├── api
│   │   └── joke.ts
│   └── index.tsx
├── static
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── logo.svg
└── twind.config.ts
```

Since I want to deploy this to my Linux server as a Docker container, the first thing to do is create a Docker file:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

```Dockerfile
FROM denoland/deno:1.35.0

EXPOSE 8000

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

CMD ["deno", "run", "-A", "main.ts"]
```

For testing purposes, let's build the container on our local machine and go for a test drive to see if it's working:

```bash
# within your project root (also the place where the Dockerfile is located) run
docker build -t deno-fresh .
```

Now you can start the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name deno-fresh -p 8000:8000 deno-fresh
```

The Deno app is now available on your `localhost:8000`. Try it out in the browser. Now we are all set to start working with GitHub Actions, our actual target.

## Create the First Workflow

In the root folder, create `.github`, and within that, a `workflows` folder. Then create a new file called `deploy.yml`. This file describes our deployment workflow and is structured into jobs. Within the jobs, we define the system we want the jobs to run on (in our example, it's `ubuntu`), and we specify the `actions` needed to build and deploy our app. Here's a simple demo; normally, there should also be a test step where all automated tests are triggered:

```yml
name: 🚀 Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 🚛 Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 🔐 Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{github.actor}}
          password: ${{secrets.CR_PAT}}

      - name: 👷‍♂️ Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
        env:
          IMAGE_TAG: latest
          IMAGE_NAME: actions-noob
  deploy:
    name: 🐳 Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.SSH_PASSWORD }}
          port: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
          script: |
            docker login ghcr.io -u ${{github.actor}} --password-stdin <<< ${{secrets.CR_PAT}}
            docker stop ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} 
            docker rm ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }}
            docker pull ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
            docker run -d --name ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }} -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
        env:
          IMAGE_TAG: latest
          IMAGE_NAME: actions-noob
          CONTAINER_NAME: deno-actions-noob
```
## Conclusion

Embarking on the journey to learn GitHub Actions and automation has been an enlightening experience.
