Beside the global pandemic, 2020 was actually a good year for me. 2019 has entitled the worst year - personally and job wise. But right from the beginning I could see this year would be definitly better. In 2019 I joined a company fulltime which used to be a freelance client from me. At first it was great but 4 months in it turned into a nightmare. So I decided in July to apply for a job at my current company - Frauscher Sensortechnik. I started there in November 2019 and at first was overwhelmed by the complexity of the products. But with each month I got more into the product ecosystem and now completly love my position as software engineer for our railway axle counting diagnostics product, where I work mainly on the frontend of the webservice.

## 2020 Sideprojects

This year I did not find the time I'd liked for my sideprojects. I had some cool freelance gigs here and there and this side (I count it even though some parts are still missing ðŸ˜‰)

## What's planned for 2021

Right now I'm shaping a sideproject which is called Shoebox. It is a simple invoicing webapp for freelancers. The stack will be the TALL (Tailwind - Alpine.js - -Laravel - Livewire). As I found some time in the last week to play with this technoligy I began to like it and I'm curious what Shoebox will look like.

## Shape up Health and Fitness

2021 should also become a turnaround in case of health. In the last three years I gained a lot of weight and also did nearly no sports. So I started to track calories and I reactivated my nice and simple home gym ðŸ’ª. In january I will invest into an Assault Airbike to round up the gym and punish myself ðŸ˜….

## Books I want to read in 2021

Whilst I'm reading every single day, most of the time its blog articles, code or some short stories. I tried to read Atomic Habits but my attention span is so short that I grab my phone whilst 5min into the book and then I stopped while I was 25% in. The rest I listened as audio book. As I encountered my attention weakness I also will be pushing this in the new year. This are the five books I definitly want to read in 2021:

- Shape up by Basecamp
- Master TypeScript In 50 Short Lessons by Stefan Baumgartner
- The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth
- The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
- Factfullness by Hans Rosling

And that's it. A lot of interesting things to do and I'm curious how this recap will look like in exactly one year from now. Happy New Year!
