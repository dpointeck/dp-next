                        Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Pointecker
                    </h2> 
                    <p>a self-taught software developer from the picturesque town of SchÃ¤rding, 
                    Upper Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ Since diving into the world of web development in 2014, 
                    I've been on a thrilling journey of growth and discovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My adventure in web development began with mastering the fundamentals: 
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
                    As I delved deeper, my interests evolved towards the Node.js ecosystem, 
                    enhancing my projects with frameworks like Vue and React, 
                    and leveraging TypeScript for its powerful type-checking features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    More recently, my professional path has led me to work on innovative projects 
                    for diagnostic systems in railway signaling. In this niche, 
                    I embrace the role of a full-stack developer, crafting system software in Rust. 
                    This transition not only signifies a pivot in my technical focus 
                    but also underlines my versatility and eagerness to tackle complex challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm captivated by web development's ever-changing landscape, which constantly offers new knowledge to absorb and fresh challenges to overcome.
